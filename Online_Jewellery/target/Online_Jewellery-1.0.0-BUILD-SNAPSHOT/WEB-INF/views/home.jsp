			<h1>JEWELLERY ON DEMAND</h1>
			<p class="lead">Fashion jewelry or costume jewellery is jewellery that is worn just for fashion, and is not made of expensive materials.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Jewellery refers to any clothing accessory that is worn as a decoration.

In itself, jewellery has no other purpose than to look attractive. However, it is often added to items that have a practical function. Items such as belts and handbags are mainly accessories but may be decorated. A broach, often worn to keep a cloak closed, could be highly decorated with jewels.

Necklaces, finger rings and earrings are the most usual kinds of jewellery.</p>
